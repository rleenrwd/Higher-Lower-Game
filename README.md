## By Robert L. Norwood
This simple game is designed to have a user try to guess which option, A or B, has a larger social media following. The goal is to get as many correct and accumulate the highest score. Thus, giving you bragging rights about your knowledge of who the most popular people on social media are! 

This program uses the unittest module to test the functionality of the game, assuring every function does what it is supposed to do. This game is designed using the Python programming language.
